Based on the following detected technologies for project '{project_id}':

{tech_data}

Generate an 'Internal AI Technical Context'. This document will be used as background knowledge for future coding and debugging tasks. Focus on:

1. Technical Mapping: How these specific technologies interlink in this architecture (e.g., ORM to Database, Framework to Package Manager).
2. Constraints & Gotchas: List version-specific limitations, known bottlenecks of this stack, or strict architectural constraints that must be respected.
3. Developer/AI Notes: Key technical patterns identified. What should an AI agent know before modifying this specific codebase?

FORMAT: Use a structured, technical format (e.g., Markdown Headers). 
GOAL: Create a "Technical Memory" that makes future tasks more accurate. Do not explain basic concepts; focus on integration and constraints.
