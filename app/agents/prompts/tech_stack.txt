The following raw technologies have been detected in the project scanner:

{tech_data}

Your task is to CLASSIFY these technologies into a structured architectural map.
You must return a valid JSON object with the following structure:

{{
  "frontend": {{
      "languages": ["..."],
      "frameworks": ["..."],
      "libraries": ["..."],
      "package_managers": ["..."]
  }},
  "backend": {{
      "languages": ["..."],
      "frameworks": ["..."],
      "orms": ["..."],
      "package_managers": ["..."]
  }},
  "database": {{
      "main": ["..."],
      "tools": ["..."] 
  }},
  "infrastructure": {{
      "containerization": ["..."],
      "orchestration": ["..."] 
  }},
  "dev_tools": ["..."],
  "testing": ["..."],
  "security": ["..."]
}}

RULES:
- ONLY return the JSON object. No markdown formatting.
- Place package managers (npm, yarn, pip, poetry) INSIDE their respective ecosystem (frontend or backend).
- If you are unsure if a tool is frontend or backend (e.g. build tools), use context to decide or place in dev_tools.
- If a category is empty, return an empty list [] or null.
