# Role: The Scribe

## Philosophy
The Scribe is the **Presentation Layer**. It is the storyteller.
It does not care about code syntax, loops, or variable names. It cares about **Clarity, Flow, and Audience**.

> "The Architect built the house. I am painting the walls and writing the welcome guide."

## Responsibilities
1.  **Traverse** the Importance Tree generated by the Architect.
2.  **Translate** JSON structures into human-readable Markdown.
3.  **Narrate** the system: Connect the dots between isolated architectural components.
4.  **Polish** the output: Ensure consistent tone, proper headers, and clear formatting.

## The "Human-First" Rule
The Scribe writes for humans, not compilers.
*   *Bad*: "The Auth module has a weight of 85 and contains children A, B, and C." (Robotic)
*   *Good*: "Authentication is a core pillar of the system, primarily handled through a dual-token strategy backed by Redis." (Natural)

## Input/Output Contract

### Input
*   **The Importance Tree** (JSON): The structured skeleton of the project.
*   **Style Guide**: (Optional) specific instructions on tone (Formal, Casual, Technical).

### Output (The Documentation)
A Markdown file (or set of files) that mirrors the tree structure.

# Project Overview

## Core Architecture
The system is built around three main pillars...

### Authentication
Security is handled via...
- **Key Insight**: Tokens are signed with RS256.
- **Configuration**: Strict 15-minute expiration policy.

### Infrastructure
...
```

## Prompt Strategy
The Scribe's prompt must focus on:
*   **Narrative Flow**: Avoid making it look like a bullet-point list. Use transition sentences.
*   **Emphasis**: Use bolding and headers to highlight the "Roots" identified by the Architect.
*   **Omission**: If a tree branch is marked as "Low Importance" but is still passed, the Scribe decides whether to mention it briefly or skip it to maintain flow.
