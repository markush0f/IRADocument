  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe `ira/app/modules/types` module defines various types and data structures used throughout the project to improve type safety and clarity. It employs the `typing` module to leverage type hints for better maintainability and error prevention.\n\n## File-by-File Analysis\n\n### FILE: ira/app/modules/types/MEMORY_UNIT_TYPE.py\n- **Purpose**: This file defines a type named `MemoryUnit` that restricts acceptable values to specific units of measurement for memory.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**:  \n  - `MemoryUnit`: A type defined using `Literal` from the `typing` module, which restricts values to 'kb', 'mb', or 'gb'. This enhances type safety in memory-related operations, ensuring that only valid memory units are utilized in the codebase.\n- **Dependencies**: It relies on the `Literal` from the `typing` module.\n\n### FILE: ira/app/modules/types/TOP_MEMORY_FIELDS_TYPE.py\n- **Purpose**: This file establishes structured type definitions that aid in managing memory data consistently across the application.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**:  \n  - `TopMemoryField`: Defined using `Literal`, it restricts acceptable memory field strings to a specified set. This structure ensures that all memory field identifiers used throughout the code are valid.\n  - `TOP_MEMORY_FIELDS`: A set containing valid memory field identifiers, which restricts variable assignments to these predefined fields.\n- **Module Interface**: The presence of the `__all__` list indicates which components are publicly accessible when the module is imported, specifically `TopMemoryField` and `TOP_MEMORY_FIELDS`.\n- **Data Constraints**: This structure helps maintain consistency in memory data management and reduces potential errors.\n\n### FILE: ira/app/modules/types/DOCKER_STATUS.py\n- **Purpose**: This file defines valid states for Docker containers, enhancing type checking and improving readability in status management.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**:  \n  - `DOCKER_STATUS`: A `Literal` type that contains specific string values representing different Docker container states. This ensures that only recognized states can be used, improving overall code quality and comprehension.\n- **Dependencies**: The code relies on `Literal` from the `typing` module.  \n\n## Inter-Module Communication\nThis module communicates with other modules by providing structured types (like `MemoryUnit`, `TopMemoryField`, and `DOCKER_STATUS`) that improve type safety and consistency across the application. These types can be referenced in other parts of the codebase to ensure correct data handling.\n\n## Configuration\nThere are no specific external configurations or environment variables mentioned for this module; the types are defined statically within their respective files, enhancing type safety during code execution.",
