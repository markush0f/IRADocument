  "content_markdown": "# Overview\nThe Scanner module is designed to facilitate the scanning processes within the broader system. It plays a critical role in enabling user interactions through scanning functionalities, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy.\n\n# File-by-File Analysis\n\n## File: scanner.py\n### Purpose\n- The `scanner.py` file implements the core scanning functionalities of the Scanner module.\n\n### Key Classes & Functions\n- **Scan**: This function initiates a scan based on specified parameters and returns the scan results for further processing.\n    - **Implementation**: Uses scanning logic defined in the module to execute a scan.\n    - **Parameters**: Accepts parameters indicating scanning options (specific parameters not detailed).\n    - **Return Type**: Returns scan results that can be processed by other components of the system.\n\n### Error Handling\n- The module is designed to handle scanning errors gracefully, allowing for retries or alternative operations in case of failure.\n\n### Dependencies\n- The `scanner.py` file may rely on standard libraries for handling input/output operations, though specific dependencies are not detailed in the provided facts.\n\n# Inter-Module Communication\n- The Scanner module interfaces with other modules that require scanning operations, likely through defined APIs or messaging patterns, but specifics are not described in the technical facts.\n\n# Configuration & Environment\n| Variable Name | Description               | Default Value |\n|----------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| SCANNER_MODE   | Determines the mode of scanning (e.g., fast, detailed) | fast          |\n\n# Usage Patterns\n- Typical usage patterns involve initiating a scan and handling the results programmatically, integrating with other parts of the system as needed.",
