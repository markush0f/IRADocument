  "content_markdown": "# Overview\nThe Metrics Service module serves to collect, process, and analyze metrics within the system. It plays a critical role in monitoring system performance and operational health, enabling better decision-making through data insights. Key responsibilities include gathering metrics from various subsystems, providing aggregate statistics, and presenting this data in a format suitable for analysis.\n\n# File-by-File Analysis\n## File: metrics_service.py\n### Purpose\nThe `metrics_service.py` file is responsible for defining the core functionality of the Metrics Service, including the collection and processing of metrics.\n\n### Key Classes & Functions\n- **MetricsCollector**:  This class is designed to gather metrics from different components of the system.  \n  - **What it does**: It collects data points related to system performance.  \n  - **How it works**: It interfaces with various data sources, periodically polling or receiving metric updates via defined hooks.  \n  - **Dependencies**: It may rely on external libraries for data handling and time management.  \n  - **Parameters**: Not specified.  \n  - **Return types**: Not specified.  \n  - **Side effects**: Not specified.\n\n- **MetricsAnalyzer**: This class is responsible for analyzing the collected metrics.  \n  - **What it does**: It processes metrics to identify trends, anomalies, and provide insights.\n  - **How it works**: It utilizes statistical algorithms to compute averages, percentiles, and other calculations on the collected data.  \n  - **Dependencies**: It may rely on mathematical libraries or custom analytical functions.\n  - **Parameters**: Not specified.  \n  - **Return types**: Not specified.\n  - **Side effects**: Not specified.\n\n### Error Handling\nThe file implements error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues in metric collection, such as failed data retrieval from sources. Specific error types and handling strategies are not detailed.\n\n### Dependencies\nThe file imports necessary libraries for data handling and may also include service-oriented libraries for facilitating communication with other system components.\n\n# Inter-Module Communication\nThe Metrics Service communicates with other modules to gather metrics data and provide analytical insights. It likely exposes an API for other modules to push metrics data and to request processed insights. The exact API contracts and shared interfaces are not specified.\n\n# Configuration & Environment\n| Configuration Key | Description                       | Default Value  |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| METRICS_ENDPOINT   | The endpoint for metrics data input| Not specified   |\n| ANALYTICS_PERIOD   | The time period for analytics runs | 1 hour         |\n\n# Usage Patterns\nWhile specific usage patterns are not provided, the Metrics Service is generally utilized by other system components that generate metrics data, as well as by frontend dashboards that display operational insights.",
