  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe `ira/app/modules/systemd/simple` module provides functionalities for parsing and managing systemd services, particularly through the interpretation of service outputs from systemctl commands. This module is crucial in maintaining organized and efficient service monitoring and control within the larger application framework.\n\n## File-by-File Analysis\n\n### File: ira/app/modules/systemd/simple/parser.py\n- **Purpose**: This file contains the `parse_systemctl_show` function designed to process and parse systemd service outputs specifically focusing on key-value pairs representing service attributes.\n\n- **Key Functions**:\n  - **`parse_systemctl_show`**:  \n    - **Functionality**: Processes output from systemctl commands by parsing individual blocks separated by double newlines, subsequently extracting key-value pairs.\n    - **Data Handling**: Initializes an empty list called `services` to store parsed service data, creating a dictionary for each service while handling empty values by assigning them as `None`.\n    - **Control Flow**: Skips any line that does not contain an equals sign, ensuring that only valid key-value pairs are processed.  \n\n- **Error Handling**: While the function does not specify extensive error handling, it handles lines without equals signs to prevent processing invalid data.\n\n- **Dependencies**: This function does not have external dependencies mentioned in the facts.\n\n### File: ira/app/modules/systemd/simple/__init__.py\n- **Purpose**: The `__init__.py` file is used to initialize the module, signaling that `ira/app/modules/systemd/simple` is a package.\n\n- **Key Functions/Classes**: No specific functions or classes are listed in the facts for this file.\n\n- **Error Handling**: There is no mentioned error handling in this file.\n\n- **Dependencies**: This file does not list any dependencies in the facts.\n\n## Inter-Module Communication\nThe module interacts mainly with the `subprocess` library to manage system commands as inferred from related files but is focused on parsing outputs from systemctl commands specifically. Seamless integration with other system modules is expected, especially with the commands related to service management. \n\n## Configuration\nThere are no specific environment variables or configuration constants mentioned in the facts for this module. The functionality relies on command outputs rather than configurable parameters.",
