  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe `ira/app/modules/internet` module is designed to handle network-related data, specifically focusing on measuring interface traffic and capturing latency metrics. It provides structured data types for ease of use and clarity in network-related functionalities, ensuring robust monitoring of network performance across multiple interfaces.\n\n## File-by-File Analysis\n\n### File: ira/app/modules/internet/types.py\n- **Purpose**: This file defines structured data types using TypedDicts to provide clarity and safety for network metrics.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**:  \n  - `InterfaceTraffic`: TypedDict representing the traffic metrics for a network interface, ensuring structured access to traffic data.  \n  - `LatencyMetrics`: TypedDict representing various latency metrics to maintain consistency in data handling.  \n  - `InterfacesTraffic`: A dictionary mapping string keys to `InterfaceTraffic` objects, enabling representation of multiple interfaces' traffic statistics under a single structure.\n- **Error Handling**: No specific error handling is noted for this file.\n- **Dependencies**: The module relies on Python's typing library for TypedDict functionality.\n\n### File: ira/app/modules/internet/interfaces.py\n- **Purpose**: This file contains functions to measure and report traffic statistics on network interfaces.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**:  \n  - `measure_interfaces_traffic`: This function utilizes `psutil` to retrieve network I/O counters for each network interface, returning a structured dictionary with received and sent bytes of data.\n- **Error Handling**: No specific error handling is noted for this file.\n- **Dependencies**: The implementation depends on the `psutil` library to access network statistics.\n\n### File: ira/app/modules/internet/snapshot.py\n- **Purpose**: The specific functionality of this file is not detailed, but it is part of the internet module.\n- **Key Functions/Classes**: No specific functions are listed in the provided facts for this file.\n- **Error Handling**: No error handling details are provided.\n- **Dependencies**: No dependencies are mentioned for this file.\n\n## Inter-Module Communication\nThe internet module interacts with other modules, particularly by utilizing data types and metrics that can be integrated into broader system monitoring functionalities. The functions provided allow for the collection of network data that may be used by different components of the application requiring network metrics.\n\n## Configuration\nThis module does not specify any environment variables or constants. All implementations are based directly on provided abstractions within the code, particularly tailored for network performance monitoring without external configuration requirements.",
