  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe subsystem comprises various components responsible for scanning and managing technology metadata across different types of projects. This includes the identification of Docker configurations, JavaScript frameworks, database schemas, and Python frameworks, ensuring that each aspect of the technology landscape is clearly defined and managed.\n\n## Key Concepts\n### Scanning Patterns\n- **Docker Configuration Patterns**: The subsystem is capable of identifying Docker-related files, crucial for containerized applications, which enhances the scanning process for various technology stacks.\n- **Framework Metadata Access**: By centralizing metadata about JavaScript and Python frameworks, the subsystem can accurately detect and manage project dependencies, which streamlines development workflows.\n\n### Database Relationships\n- **Model Relationships**: Utilizes SQLModel to define structured relationships between core entities in the database, such as Projects, Files, Facts, and Relations. This facilitates complex data interactions and maintains referential integrity.\n\n## Diagrams\nHere’s a representation of the subsystem’s architecture using a Mermaid diagram:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Project] -->|contains| B[File];\n    A -->|contains| C[Fact];\n    A -->|contains| D[Relation];\n    A -->|contains| E[TreeNode];\n    F[Docker Config] -->|identifies| A;\n    G[JavaScript Metadata] -->|provides| A;\n    H[Database Scanner] -->|analyzes| A;\n```\n\nThis diagram illustrates the relations and interactions among various components, emphasizing the core `Project` entity as the focal point of the subsystem.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- **Frameworks**: SQLModel for data modeling and management.\n- **Scripts**: Python for defining metadata and scanning functionality, ensuring a flexible environment for technology detection.\n- **Tools**: Docker for container management integration, providing a modern approach to application deployment and development.",
