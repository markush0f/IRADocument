  "content_markdown": "# Infrastructure Module Reference\n\n## Overview\nThe Infrastructure module provides functionalities for managing Git repositories and creating isolated workspaces for project analysis.\n\n## Files Analysis\n\n### File: git_client.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements Git repository management using the `git` library and integrates with the GitHub API using `httpx`.\n- **Key Functionalities**:\n  - **Dependency Management**: Utilizes the `git` library for repository operations and `httpx` for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.\n  - **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling with descriptive `RuntimeError` messages for failed Git commands.\n  - **Configuration**: Configures the Git client using an optional GitHub token and base API URL, retrieving tokens from environment variables to enhance security.\n  - **Branch Management**: Provides methods for managing branches, including `checkout_branch` for switching or creating branches, and `list_local_branches` for fetching local branch names.\n  - **Repository Interaction**: Supports cloning repositories with branch and depth options, opening local repository paths, and retrieving information about the latest commit.\n\n### File: workspace.py\n- **Purpose**: Manages the creation and management of isolated workspaces for project analysis.\n- **Key Functionalities**:\n  - **Workspace Management**: Generates unique workspace directories based on the system's temporary directory using `uuid4().hex` to ensure uniqueness.\n  - **File System Operations**: Features methods for directory management, including:\n    - `create`: Creates the workspace directory safely.\n    - `cleanup`: Deletes the workspace directory and its contents to prevent resource leakage.\n  - **Configuration**: Allows optional specification of a base directory during workspace initialization, defaulting to a subdirectory of the system's temp directory named 'ira-docgen'.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Utilizes the following modules:\n  - `git`: For performing repository operations.\n  - `httpx`: For making HTTP requests to interact with the GitHub API.\n  - `uuid`: For generating unique identifiers for workspace management.\n  - `os`: For file system operations related to workspace management.",
