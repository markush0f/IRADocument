  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe **Backend API** subsystem is responsible for handling all server-side logic, processing client requests, interacting with the database, and serving responses back to the client. It acts as the intermediary between the frontend user interface and the underlying data storage systems.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### 1. Uses Repository Pattern\nThe subsystem implements the **Repository Pattern** to abstract the data layer. This pattern allows for a clean separation of concerns and improves the maintainability of the code. The repositories handle data access logic, ensuring that the rest of the application can remain agnostic of how data is actually stored.\n\n### 2. Event-Driven Architecture\nThe Backend API employs an **Event-Driven Architecture** to handle asynchronous processing. It leverages events and message queues to decouple components within the system, allowing for scalability and better performance across distributed systems.\n\n### 3. RESTful API Design\nEndpoints are designed following **RESTful principles**, which allows clients to interact with the API in a standardized way. This design ensures stateless interactions, resource representation, and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.\n\n## Component Flow\nThe following diagram illustrates the flow of a request through the Backend API subsystem:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Client Request] --> B{API Gateway};\n    B -->|HTTP Request| C[Controller];\n    C -->|Service Call| D[Service Layer];\n    D -->|Data Access| E[Repository];\n    E -->|Database Query| F[Database];\n    F -->|Data Response| E;\n    E -->|Data Response| D;\n    D -->|Service Response| C;\n    C -->|HTTP Response| B;\n    B -->|Response to Client| A;\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\nThe key libraries and technologies used in the Backend API subsystem include:\n- **Node.js**: For building asynchronous server-side applications.\n- **Express.js**: To handle routing and middleware for the API.\n- **MongoDB**: As the primary database for data storage.\n- **Mongoose**: An ODM library to manage data relationships and schemas.\n- **RabbitMQ**: For implementing messaging queues in an event-driven architecture.\n- **Jest**: For unit testing and ensuring code quality.\n\nThis architecture enables a robust and scalable Backend API that efficiently serves client requests while maintaining clear separation of concerns and modularity.",
