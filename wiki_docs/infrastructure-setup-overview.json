  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe subsystem under review provides critical functionalities for the application, serving as the intermediary layer between the database and the user interface (UI). It handles data processing, business logic execution, and communication with external services.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Uses Repository Pattern\nThe architecture adopts the Repository Pattern to abstract data access layer interactions, making the system less dependent on the underlying database technology. This facilitates easier testing and maintenance as repositories serve as the intermediaries between the data models and the business logic.\n\n### Event-Driven Architecture\nWithin this subsystem, an event-driven approach is employed to handle asynchronous operations. Events trigger responses in different components of the system, allowing for scalability and improved performance as services can respond independently, ensuring that user interface remains responsive to the users.\n\n## Diagrams\nHere’s a visual representation of the subsystem’s architecture and flow:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[User] -->|Interacts with| B[Frontend]\n    B -->|Sends request to| C[Backend API]\n    C -->|Uses| D[Repository Layer]\n    D -->|Accesses| E[Database]\n    C -->|Emits Event| F[Event Bus]\n    F -->|Triggers| G[Service 1]\n    F -->|Triggers| H[Service 2]\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\nThe following libraries and technologies are integral to the subsystem:\n- **Express.js**: For building the API structure.\n- **Mongoose**: To model the database schemas and manage data relationships.\n- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication features.\n- **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.",
