  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe **Scanning Subsystem** is responsible for identifying various technologies across code repositories. This includes detecting programming languages, frameworks, package managers, and necessary configuration files. The subsystem implements modular scanning processes for multiple ecosystems such as Python, JavaScript, Docker, and databases. By structuring the output as a series of dictionaries, it enables seamless integration and consumption by other components of the application.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Modular Architecture\nDesigned with a modular approach, the subsystem comprises individual scanners for each technology. Each scanner is responsible for a specific technology ecosystem, enhancing maintainability and extensibility.\n\n### Error Handling\nRobust error handling mechanisms are integrated throughout the scanning processes. By utilizing `try-except` blocks, the subsystem ensures that errors in one component do not disrupt the overall scanning workflow.\n\n### Structured Data Return\nThe subsystem returns data in structured formats, including boolean flags and metadata lists, which facilitate straightforward consumption for analysis or presentation.\n\n### Logging\nA comprehensive logging strategy is employed to provide insights into the scanning process, which aids in debugging and monitoring.\n\n## Diagrams\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Scanning Subsystem] --> B[Technology Scanner];\n    B --> C[PythonScanner];\n    B --> D[JavaScriptScanner];\n    B --> E[DockerScanner];\n    B --> F[DatabaseScanner];\n    C --> G[README Scanner];\n    D --> H[Frameworks Scanner];\n    E --> I[Docker Files Scanner];\n    F --> J[Database Files Scanner];\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Python\n- `Pathlib` for file path manipulations\n- `logging` for logging events\n- Custom modules for handling scanning specificities across technologies",
