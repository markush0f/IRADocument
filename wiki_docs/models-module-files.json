  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe `app/models` module defines the database schema and relationships for projects, files, and associated hierarchical data structures using SQLModel.\n\n## File Analysis\n\n### File: file.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `File` class used for representing files associated with projects in a relational database.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - `File` class includes fields:\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking the file to a specific project.\n    - `path`: The file's location in the project directory.\n    - Optional fields: `hash`, `language`, `summary` for storing additional metadata.\n  - Establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `Project` model, ensuring each file is linked to its corresponding project.\n\n### File: tree_node.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements the `TreeNode` class for hierarchical structures within projects.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - `TreeNode` class captures essential attributes:\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking the node to a specific project.\n    - `path`: The path of the node within the tree structure.\n    - `priority`: Default is 'medium', indicating the node's importance.\n    - `status`: Default is 'pending', indicating the node's processing state.\n   - Includes optional fields like `reason` and timestamps for management of node records.\n   - Establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `Project` model, maintaining referential integrity.\n\n### File: project.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `Project` class representing project entities in the database.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - `Project` class includes:\n    - Essential fields: `id`, `name`, `root_path`, timestamps for management.\n  - Establishes relationships with multiple models including `File`, `Fact`, `Relation`, `TreeNode`, facilitating complex data interactions.\n  - Maps to the `projects` table, ensuring alignment of class representation and database schema.\n\n### File: fact.py\n- **Purpose**: Creates the `Fact` class representing fact data associated with projects.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - `Fact` class includes fields:\n    - `id`: Unique identifier for the fact.\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking the fact to its corresponding project.\n    - `type`, `source`, `payload`, `confidence`: Attributes for diverse data storage.\n  - Implements a foreign key constraint ensuring each fact is linked to a specific project.\n  - Includes a `created_at` timestamp for historical record-keeping.\n\n### File: relation.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `Relation` class for managing relationships between nodes in the context of a project.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - `Relation` class includes:\n    - Primary keys `project_id`, `from_node`, `to_node`, `relation`:\n    - Imposes a foreign key constraint on `project_id`, linking to the `projects` table.\n    - Establishes a relationship with the `Project` model for cross-referencing data.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The module directly interacts with:\n  - `Project` module: Provides structural relationships across `File`, `TreeNode`, `Fact`, and `Relation`.\n\nThis documentation provides an overview of the models utilized for managing projects and their associated data within the application. Each model serves a distinct purpose and contributes to the application's overall data integrity and structure.",
