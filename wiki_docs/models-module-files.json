  "content_markdown": "## Overview\n\nThe Models module provides SQLModel class definitions representing entities such as projects, files, and tree structures in a relational database.\n\n## File: file.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `File` class representing files associated with projects.  \n- **Key Features**:\n  - `File` class includes fields for:\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking to the `Project` model.\n    - `path`: The file's storage path.\n    - Metadata fields:\n      - `hash`: Optional hash for file integrity checks.\n      - `language`: The programming language of the file.\n      - `summary`: Optional description for ease of understanding.\n- **Database Relationship**:\n  - Establishes a one-to-many relationship with `Project` allowing each file to be linked to its corresponding project.\n\n## File: tree_node.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements the `TreeNode` class representing nodes in a hierarchical structure.  \n- **Key Features**:\n  - `TreeNode` class captures attributes such as:\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking back to the `Project` model.\n    - `path`: The node path in the hierarchy.\n    - `priority`: With default value 'medium', indicating the node's processing importance.\n    - `status`: Default value is 'pending', used for node processing state.\n    - Optional fields:\n      - `reason`: Provides a rationale for the node's state.\n      - Timestamps for tracking creation and updates.\n- **Database Relationship**:\n  - Implements a many-to-one relationship with `Project`, ensuring each node is linked to a specific project.\n\n## File: project.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `Project` class to represent project entities.  \n- **Key Features**:\n  - The `Project` class includes fields:\n    - `id`: Unique identifier for the project.\n    - `name`: The name of the project.\n    - `root_path`: Base directory path for the project.\n    - Timestamps for tracking creation and updates.\n- **Database Relationships**:\n  - Manages relationships with other entities: `File`, `Fact`, `Relation`, `TreeNode` which facilitates complex interactions across data models.\n- **Database Configuration**:\n  - Maps to the `projects` table in the database, aligning class and table representations.  \n\n## File: fact.py\n- **Purpose**: Creates the `Fact` class for storing factual data related to projects.  \n- **Key Features**:\n  - The `Fact` class comprises:\n    - `id`: Unique identifier for the fact.\n    - `project_id`: Foreign key linking to the respective `Project`.\n    - `type`: Specifies the type of fact recorded.\n    - Optional attributes:\n      - `source`: Origin of the fact.\n      - `payload`: Additional data supporting the fact.\n      - `confidence`: A metric indicating the reliability of the fact.\n    - `created_at`: Timestamp for fact creation.\n- **Database Relationship**:\n  - Another many-to-one relationship with `Project` to ensure data connectivity between facts and projects.\n\n## File: relation.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the `Relation` class to manage relationships between nodes in a project.  \n- **Key Features**:\n  - The `Relation` class includes:\n    - Primary keys such as `project_id`, `from_node`, `to_node`, and `relation` for linking nodes.\n    - Imposes a foreign key on `project_id` referencing the `projects` table.\n- **Database Relationship**:\n  - Facilitates access to associated project data through the established relationship with the `Project` model.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The Models module communicates with several other modules:\n  - `File` and `Project` models are interconnected, ensuring proper linking of files to their parent project.\n  - `TreeNode` and `Relation` classes refer back to the `Project` model, maintaining integrity within the hierarchical relationships.",
