  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe Storage module provides data access functionalities for managing various entities related to projects in an asynchronous database context.\n\n## Files Analysis\n\n### File: project_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Implements the `ProjectRepository` class to manage `Project` entities with an asynchronous session.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `ProjectRepository`: Extends `BaseRepository`, includes the method:  \n        - `get_with_files(project_id: int)`: Retrieves a project by its ID with eager loading of associated files.\n\n### File: fact_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Implements the `FactRepository` class to manage `Fact` entities using asynchronous session handling.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `FactRepository`: Extends `BaseRepository`, includes the method:  \n        - `get_by_project(project_id: int)`: Retrieves all facts associated with the given project ID.\n\n### File: relation_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Defines the `RelationRepository` class for managing `Relation` entities in an asynchronous manner.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `RelationRepository`: Extends `BaseRepository`, includes the method:  \n        - `get_by_project(project_id: int)`: Retrieves all relations associated with the specified project ID.\n\n### File: tree_node_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Implements the `TreeNodeRepository` class for managing `TreeNode` entities in an async context.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `TreeNodeRepository`: Extends `BaseRepository`, includes methods such as:  \n        - `get_node(project_id: int, path: str)`: Retrieves a specific tree node based on `project_id` and `path`.  \n        - `get_pending_nodes(project_id: int)`: Retrieves pending nodes ordered by priority.  \n        - `get_project_tree(project_id: int)`: Fetches all nodes for a specific project ID.\n\n### File: file_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Implements data access methods for managing `File` records associated with projects.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `FileRepository`: Includes the method:  \n        - `get_by_project(project_id: int)`: Retrieves all file records linked to a specific project ID.\n\n### File: base_repository.py  \n- **Purpose**: Defines the `BaseRepository` class for CRUD operations on SQLModel objects.  \n- **Key Classes/Functions**:  \n    - `BaseRepository`: Provides generic methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in an asynchronous database context.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The Storage module communicates with other components of the application through the following dependencies:\n  - `SQLModel`: Utilized for database operations and session management across repositories.\n  - `BaseRepository`: Serves as the foundational class for other repository classes in the module, providing general CRUD functionality.",
