  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe Miner module is designed to analyze files and extract structured conclusions using the `MinerAgent` class and various supporting components.\n\n## File Analysis\n\n### File: agent.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements the `MinerAgent` class that orchestrates file analysis and conclusion extraction.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Agent Functionality**: Utilizes an `AgentExecutor` combined with `MINER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` for file analysis, ensuring systematic processing through defined user messages and tool registration.\n  - **Asynchronous Execution**: Features asynchronous methods like `analyze_file` and `analyze_batch`, allowing for simultaneous processing which improves performance via non-blocking execution.\n  - **Error Handling and Fallback Logic**: Robust error management is included in the analysis methods, facilitating failure logging and fallback mechanics using regex to extract data from response strings.\n  - **Batch Analysis**: Supports analyzing multiple files at once through `analyze_batch`, which creates a unified context string for streamlined evaluations.\n  - **Data Schemas**: Defines JSON schemas using Pydantic for structured outputs, ensuring consistent formatting of conclusions.\n\n### File: schema.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines data models that validate analysis results and output structures.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Data Modeling**: Involves `MinerConclusion`, `MinerOutput`, and `MinerBatchOutput` classes for strict validation of results, enhancing clarity.\n  - **Field Descriptions**: Uses Pydantic's `Field` function for attribute descriptions, supporting self-explanatory modeling that benefits future maintenance and usability.\n  - **List and Type Safety**: Implements type annotations (e.g., `List`, `Literal`) for ensuring data integrity and preventing runtime errors.\n\n### File: prompts.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the system prompt that guides the Miner’s analysis process.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - **Prompt Definition**: Establishes the `MINER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` as a structured guideline for documentation extraction from code.\n  - **Guidelines for Extraction**: Details roles, responsibilities, and context for extracting information while stressing the exclusion of boilerplate code.\n  - **Quality Assurance**: Advocates reliable extraction practices, contrasting poor vs. good examples to ensure high-quality outputs.\n  - **Focus Areas**: Identifies key technical aspects such as dependency awareness for prioritized analysis.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The Miner module likely interacts with various components or modules defined elsewhere, particularly those related to Pydantic for data validation and any underlying libraries facilitating file handling and processing required for its operation. Possible dependencies may include:\n  - **Pydantic**: For defining data models and validation.\n  - **Asynchronous Libraries**: Required for efficient asynchronous execution (e.g., `asyncio`).\n\nIn summary, the Miner module encapsulates the functionality necessary for effectively analyzing and extracting structured information from code files, with a strong emphasis on data integrity, comprehensive documentation, and operational efficiency.",
