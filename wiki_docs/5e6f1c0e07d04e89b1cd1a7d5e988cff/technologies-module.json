  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThis module is responsible for scanning and detecting various programming frameworks and technologies used within a project, focusing on Python, JavaScript, and database technologies.\n\n## File: app/scanners/technologies/metadata/python_frameworks.py\n- **Framework Detection**: Establishes a dictionary of common Python frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy) and their dependencies, aiding in the scanning and identification of projects by checking if the modules are present.\n- **Framework Configuration**: Lists configuration files related to popular Python frameworks (e.g., `manage.py` for Django, `scrapy.cfg` for Scrapy) to facilitate automated detection of framework-specific settings and management.\n- **Package Management**: Details standard package management files like `requirements.txt` (for pip) and `Pipfile` (for pipenv) to automate the setup of dependencies and project environments based on package management tools.\n\n## File: app/scanners/technologies/javascript.py\n- **File Processing**: Implements functionality to identify JavaScript and TypeScript files, navigating through the project directory while excluding `node_modules`. It also extracts framework dependencies from the `package.json` file to better analyze the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\n## File: app/scanners/technologies/database.py\n- **Scanning**: The `DatabaseScanner` class, inheriting from `TechnologyScanner`, has a `scan` method designed to identify database-related files (binary database files, SQL scripts, etc.) and logs results in a structured format.\n- **Configuration**: Utilizes constants from `database_config.py` to check for file types, such as binary database extensions and configuration files, enhancing the search for database technologies.\n- **File Iteration**: The `_iter_repo_files` method traverses the repository, skipping over directories like `.git` and `node_modules`, and uses the `rglob` method to improve scanning performance for relevant files.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The module communicates with various frameworks and technologies in Python and JavaScript, as indicated by its scanning capabilities across directory structures and configuration files.",
