  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe Models module encapsulates the database schema and data models used in the application, defining relationships and structures for effective data management.\n\n## File: file.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the data model for managing files within the application.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `File`: A SQLModel class representing the `files` table.\n    - **Fields**:\n      - `project_id`: Foreign key linking to the associated project.\n      - `path`: The file path in the project.\n      - `hash`: A hash value for file integrity verification.\n    - **Relationships**: Configured with foreign key constraints connecting to projects.\n\n## File: tree_node.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the data model for managing tree nodes that represent hierarchical structures in a project.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `TreeNode`: A SQLModel class representing the `tree_nodes` table.\n    - **Fields**:\n      - `project_id`: Foreign key linking to the associated project.\n      - `path`: The path within the tree structure.\n      - `priority`: Numeric value indicating the importance of the node.\n      - `status`: Current status of the tree node (e.g., active, inactive).\n    - **Relationships**: Manages associations with projects to detail hierarchy.\n\n## File: project.py\n- **Purpose**: Establishes the core data model for projects within the application.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `Project`: Defines a model as an SQLAlchemy table using `sqlmodel`.\n    - **Attributes**:\n      - `id`: Unique identifier for each project.\n      - `name`: Name of the project.\n      - `root_path`: Base path for the project files.\n      - Timestamps for creation and updates.\n    - **Relationships**: Defines connections to files, facts, relations, and tree nodes, facilitating organized data representation.\n\n## File: fact.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines the data model for capturing factual information related to projects.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `Fact`: Model representing the `facts` table with attributes pertinent to project facts.\n    - **Attributes**:\n      - `project_id`: Foreign key linking to the associated Project.\n      - `type`: Type of fact (e.g., annotation, observation).\n      - `source`: Source of the fact (e.g., user, automated).\n      - `payload`: Contains the actual data or information.\n      - `confidence`: A value indicating the reliability of the fact.\n\n## File: relation.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements data modeling for the relationships between project nodes.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `Relation`: Represents the connections between nodes in the project.\n    - **Attributes**:\n      - `project_id`: Foreign key identifying the project.\n      - `from_node`: Identifier for the origin node of the relationship.\n      - `to_node`: Identifier for the destination node.\n      - `relation`: Describes the nature of the relationship.\n    - **Composite Key**: Utilizes a composite primary key consisting of `project_id`, `from_node`, `to_node`, and `relation` for unique identification of each relationship.\n\n## Dependencies\n- **SQLModel**: Used for defining database schema.\n- **SQLAlchemy**: Core ORM utilized for project model structure and relationships. \n- **Interaction with other modules**: This module likely interacts with other modules that manage the application workflow and business logic, inferred through its reliance on project data structures and relationships.",
