  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThe Services module provides functionality for managing projects, performing data analysis, and handling relationships within a project management system.\n\n## File: analysis_service.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements analysis reporting and integrates AI capabilities for project insights.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `AnalysisService`\n    - `generate_analysis_report`: Constructs a report by orchestrating project analysis through a dynamic discovery pipeline, with AI integrations.\n  - Error Handling: Robust error management that logs and structures failure messages throughout the analysis process.\n  - AI Integration: Initializes AI agents via `LLMFactory.get_client`, adapting analysis based on language model capabilities.\n  - Fact Management: Retrieves project-specific facts using `FactService.get_facts_by_project`, facilitating structured reporting.\n  - Pipeline Management: Manages a `ProjectDiscoveryPipeline` to organize and execute analysis tasks.\n\n## File: project_service.py\n- **Purpose**: Handles the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of project data.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `ProjectService`\n    - CRUD operations:\n      - `create_project`: Creates a new project with timestamps.\n      - `get_project`: Retrieves a project by ID.\n      - `list_all_projects`: Lists all existing projects.\n      - `update_project`: Updates an existing project.\n      - `delete_project`: Removes a project from the system.\n\n## File: relation_service.py\n- **Purpose**: Manages relationships between project nodes.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `RelationService`\n    - `create_relation`: Registers relationships, storing relevant attributes such as `project_id`, `from_node`, and `to_node`.\n    - `get_project_relations`: Retrieves relationships for a specific project based on `project_id`.\n\n## File: file_service.py\n- **Purpose**: Manages file records linked to projects.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `FileService`\n    - `get_project_files`: Retrieves all files associated with a specific project.\n    - Updates file status to mark them as analyzed, recording timestamps and optional attributes like `language` and `file_hash`.\n\n## File: fact_service.py\n- **Purpose**: Manages facts related to projects.\n- **Key Classes/Functions**:\n  - `FactService`\n    - `create_fact`: Creates new fact entries with unique IDs and serialized payloads.\n    - `register_technology_stack_facts`: Batch processes technology facts, creating multiple facts in one method call.\n\n## Dependencies\n- The Services module interacts with several repositories such as `ProjectRepository`, `RelationRepository`, `FileRepository`, and `FactRepository` for data operations.\n- Integrates with AI components through the `LLMFactory`, enabling insights based on project data analysis.",
