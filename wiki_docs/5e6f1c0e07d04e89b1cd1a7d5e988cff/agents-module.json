  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThis module encompasses various components involved in managing agents, facilitating interactions with large language models (LLMs), and handling project relations within a dynamic analytical pipeline.\n\n## File: app/agents/tools/relation_tools.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines tools for managing architectural relations within a project.\n- **Key Functions**:\n  - `register_relation`: Registers a new relation in the project.\n  - `list_project_relations`: Lists existing relations within the project.\n- **Dependencies**: Utilizes `RelationService` to interact with the database, enabling the management of complex relationships.\n\n## File: app/agents/core/factory.py\n- **Purpose**: Responsible for creating LLM client instances based on configurations.\n- **Key Classes**:\n  - `LLMFactory`: A factory class that initializes clients like `OllamaClient` based on the supplied provider configurations.\n\n## File: app/agents/core/ollama_client.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements the Ollama client for generating responses and processing chats using the Ollama API.\n- **Key Components**:\n  - `OllamaClient`: Extends `BaseLLMClient`, leveraging `ollama.AsyncClient` to interact with the Ollama API.\n  - **Error Handling**: Logs errors during API interactions using a logger initialized via `get_logger`, which aids debugging.\n  - **Configuration**: Initializes `host` and `model` properties from configuration settings, allowing for runtime configuration.\n\n## File: app/agents/core/pipeline.py\n- **Purpose**: Manages the execution control flow of analysis stages.\n- **Key Classes**:\n  - `BasePipeline`: Manages a sequence of analysis stages with an injected `AgentExecutor`.\n  - **Tool Management**: Dynamically adjusts the tools available based on the `tools` parameter during stage execution, ensuring flexibility.\n\n## File: app/agents/discovery_pipeline.py\n- **Purpose**: Implements a pipeline for discovering technology stacks and executing various analysis stages dynamically.\n- **Key Classes**:\n  - `ProjectDiscoveryPipeline`: Manages the execution of multiple analysis stages, handling context preparation and technology detection through the `TechnologyScanner`. \n\n## Dependencies\n- **RelationService**: Required for managing architectural relations in the project.\n- **Ollama**: Provides API integration for the Ollama client.\n- **Logger**: Used for error handling and debugging in the Ollama client.",
