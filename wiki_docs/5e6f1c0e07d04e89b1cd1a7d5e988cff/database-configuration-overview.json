  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe subsystem encompasses the **Backend API**, which is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing business logic, and interacting with the database. It serves as a vital layer between client applications and data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Uses Repository Pattern**: This pattern abstracts the data layer and encapsulates the logic required to access data sources. It allows for loose coupling between the business logic and data access layers.\n- **RESTful API Design**: The API follows REST principles, enabling stateless communication and resource-based interactions, which facilitate scalability and maintenance.\n- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The subsystem employs event-driven aspects to handle asynchronous operations, improving responsiveness and reducing coupling between components.\n\n## Diagrams\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Frontend] -->|HTTP Request| B[Backend API];\n    B --> C[Service Layer];\n    C --> D[Repository];\n    C --> E[Event Queue];\n    D --> F[Database];\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building the API.\n- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful services.\n- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB, facilitating data modeling and validation.\n- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for implementing event-driven mechanisms.\n- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.\n\n",
