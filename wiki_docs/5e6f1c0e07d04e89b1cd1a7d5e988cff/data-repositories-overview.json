  "content_markdown": "# Architecture Overview\n\n## Introduction\nThe Metadata Scanner subsystem is responsible for detecting and identifying Python frameworks based on the presence of specific modules and configuration files within a given project. This functionality optimizes the scanning process for potential projects, providing insights into the frameworks and their dependencies, crucial for developers looking to manage or assess Python applications efficiently.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Framework Detection\nThe subsystem implements a dictionary-based approach to detect common Python frameworks such as Django, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. By scanning the project for these modules, it can ascertain the framework being used, which helps in understanding the architecture of the application being analyzed.\n\n### Framework Configuration\nThe system lists configuration files typical to popular Python frameworks. By identifying files like `manage.py` for Django or `scrapy.cfg` for Scrapy, it enables automated detection of framework-specific settings, facilitating the management and deployment of Python applications.\n\n### Package Management\nTo support dependency management effectively, the subsystem defines standard package management files like `requirements.txt` for `pip` and `Pipfile` for `pipenv`. This definition supports the automated setup of project environments and dependency resolution, making it easier for developers to get started with Python projects.\n\n## Diagram\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Project Directory] --> B[Scan for Framework Modules]\n    B --> C{Framework Found?}\n    C -->|Yes| D[Identify Framework and Dependencies]\n    C -->|No| E[Scan for Configuration Files]\n    E --> F{Config File Found?}\n    F -->|Yes| G[Extract Framework Settings]\n    F -->|No| H[Scan for Package Management Files]\n    H --> I{Package File Found?}\n    I -->|Yes| J[Setup Environment]\n    I -->|No| K[End]\n    D --> L[Output Framework Details]\n    G --> L\n    J --> L\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Python\n- pip\n- pipenv\n- Django\n- Flask\n- SQLAlchemy\n",
