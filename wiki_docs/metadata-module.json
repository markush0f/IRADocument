  "content_markdown": "## Overview\nThis module provides metadata definitions and patterns for identifying various technology and configuration files used across different programming languages, particularly focused on Docker, JavaScript, databases, and Python frameworks.\n\n## File: docker_config.py\n- **Purpose**: Defines standards and patterns for recognizing Docker-related configuration files.\n- **Key Elements**:\n  - `DOCKER_FILES`: List of accepted Docker configuration file patterns used for scanning.\n  - `DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILES`: Patterns specifically for Docker Compose configuration.\n  - `DOCKER_IGNORE_FILES`: Patterns for Docker ignore files.\n\n## File: javascript_frameworks.py\n- **Purpose**: Encapsulates metadata for popular JavaScript frameworks, enhancing repository scanning for technology detection.\n- **Key Elements**:\n  - `FRAMEWORK_DEPENDENCIES`: Dictionary mapping common JavaScript frameworks and their dependencies.\n  - `FRAMEWORK_CONFIGS`: Configuration filenames for various frameworks aiding in the detection of specified settings.\n  - `PACKAGE_MANAGERS`: Identifiers for package manager-related files to streamline recognition of JavaScript and TypeScript package management systems.\n\n## File: database_config.py\n- **Purpose**: Contains patterns and configurations for identifying database-related files and directories.\n- **Key Elements**:\n  - `BINARY_DB_EXTENSIONS`: Defines file patterns indicating binary database files.\n  - `SCRIPT_DB_EXTENSIONS`: Lists extensions for database scripts used in scanning.\n  - `CONFIG_FILES`: Comprehensive list of configuration files for database ORM frameworks.\n  - `DB_DIRECTORIES`: Specifies common directory names, such as 'migrations' and 'seeds', indicating database utilization.\n\n## File: python_frameworks.py\n- **Purpose**: Provides metadata for Python frameworks to assist in dependency management and configuration file identification.\n- **Key Elements**:\n  - `FRAMEWORK_DEPENDENCIES`: Dictionary linking popular frameworks like Django and Flask to their necessary packages.\n  - `FRAMEWORK_CONFIGS`: Links frameworks to their essential configuration files for quick navigation in projects.\n  - `PACKAGE_MANAGERS`: Dictionary relating common Python package managers (e.g., Pip, Poetry) to relevant configuration files like `requirements.txt` and `poetry.lock`.\n\n## Dependencies\nThis module interacts with the following components:\n- **DatabaseScanner**: Relies on metadata defined in `database_config.py` to scan and recognize database-related files and structures. \n- **Technology Scanner Framework**: Integrates with the metadata provided in `docker_config.py` and `javascript_frameworks.py` for detecting associated technologies in scanned repositories.",
