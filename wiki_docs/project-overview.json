It is crucial for understanding how the individual parts of the system come together to deliver the overall functionality.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nThis subsystem employs several key architectural patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and reliability:\n\n- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component of the system is deployed as a microservice, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.\n- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate asynchronously through events, facilitating decoupled interactions and responsiveness.\n- **Repository Pattern**: Data access is centralized within repository classes, abstracting data storage and providing a clean interface for business logic.\n\n## Diagrams\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the interaction between various services within the system:\n\n```mermaid\n graph TD\n    A[User Interface] -->|REST API| B[Service A]\n    A -->|REST API| C[Service B]\n    B -->|Event| D[Message Queue]\n    C -->|Event| D\n    D -->|Event| E[Service C]\n    E -->|Database| F[(Data Store)]\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nThe following libraries and technologies are key to the project:\n\n- **Node.js**: For building server-side applications.\n- **Express.js**: Web framework for RESTful APIs.\n- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for handling asynchronous events.\n- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for dynamic data storage.\n- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent deployment.",
